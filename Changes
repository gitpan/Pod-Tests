Changes for Perl extension Pod-Tests

1.19 Sat 12 Jul 2008
	- Moving to a production version
	- Changing to Module::Install to simplify maintenance
	- Updating perl dependency to 5.005
	- Updated author tests
	- Some slight changes to resolve Kwalitee issues
	- Stopped using MANIFEST for the tests
	- Various minor whitespace and layout tweaks

0.18 Thu 22 Sep 2005
	- Some last minor whitespace changes
	- Moving to stable build now I have feedback from testers
	- Reversion to Pod::Tests namespace complete

0.17_01 Sat 17 Sep 2005
	- Superceded by Test::Inline 2.0
	- For compatibility reasons, split out a Pod-Tests dist from the
	  main Test-Inline dist. This is now Pod::Tests again.
	- Cleaned up some Pod to reflect the changes.
	- Various other minor changes from the splitting out process

0.16 Thu 18 Dec 2003
	- Fixed binmode on STDOUT/STDERR  (thanks Max Maischein)

0.15 Thu 11 Apr 2002
	- Hacked in a solution for when code tries to redirect STDOUT or
	  STDERR.  The behavior when redirecting STDOUT & STDERR is
	  currently *UNDEFINED* but at least it doesn't blow up.
	- Off-by-some line number bugs now fixed.  Embedded tests should
	  report correct line numbers.  __LINE__ should now be correct.

0.14 Thu 28 Feb 2002
	- pod2test now provides an $Original_File
	- Fixed handling of "print STDERR ..." in tests
	- Fixed $_STDERR_ and $_STDOUT_ so they clear themselves
	  between test blocks (bug reported by Wolfgang Weisselberg)
	- Some point between Test::More 0.30 and 0.33 it became unsafe
	  to redirect STDOUT/STDERR in tests.  This broke pod2test.
	  The minimum version of Test::More has been uped (again, thanks
	  Wolfgang)

0.13 Mon 18 Feb 2002
	- pod2test now exits with 1 if it doesn't find any embedded tests

0.12 Mon 12 Nov 2001
	- An excuse to upload a new version to CPAN to get this back
	  on the indexes.

0.11 Thu 30 Aug 2001
	- Fixed a bug in the testifypods example in Test::Inline::Tutorial
	- pod2test will not generate a test file for POD which has no
	  embedded tests.
	- Testing code examples no longer considered experimental

0.10 Wed 29 Aug 2001
	- Pod::Tests is now officially named Test::Inline
	- Pod::Tests::Tutorial renamed Test::Inline::Tutorial
	- Tests are now lexically isolated
	- Works back to 5.004 now (Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
	- "=also begin example" is now "=for example begin"

0.08 Mon 13 Aug 2001
	- Now reporting the line numbers of the orignal POD entries in
	  tests.
	- Put in warning about tests being lexically isolated next version.
	- Documented that "=also for example" will never work.
	- Fixed bug with tests at the very end of the file.
